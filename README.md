An open source motor controller firmware.

This is the source code for the VESC DC/BLDC/FOC controller. Read more at
[https://vesc-project.com/](https://vesc-project.com/)

## Supported boards

All of them!

Check the supported boards by typing `make`

```
[Firmware]
     fw   - Build firmware for default target
                            supported boards are: 100_250 100_250_no_limits 100_500...
```

There are also many other options that can be changed in [conf_general.h](conf_general.h).

## Prerequisites

### On Ubuntu (Linux)/macOS
- Tools: `git`, `wget`, and `make`
- Additional Linux requirements: `libgl-dev` and `libxcb-xinerama0`
- Helpful Ubuntu commands:
```bash
sudo apt install git build-essential libgl-dev libxcb-xinerama0 wget git-gui
```
- Helpful macOS tools: 

```bash
brew install stlink
brew install openocd
```

### On Windows
- Chocolately: https://chocolatey.org/install
- Git: https://git-scm.com/download/win. Make sure to click any boxes to add Git to your Environment (aka PATH)

## Install Dev environment and build

### On Ubuntu (Linux)/MacOS
Open up a terminal
1.  `git clone http://github.com/vedderb/bldc.git`
2.  `cd bldc`
3.  Continue with [On all platforms](#on-all-platforms)

### On Windows

1.  Open up a Windows Powershell terminal (Resist the urge to run Powershell as administrator, that will break things)
2.  Type `choco install make`
3.  `git clone http://github.com/vedderb/bldc`
4.  `cd bldc`
5.  Continue with [On all platforms](#on-all-platforms)

### On all platforms

1.  `git checkout origin/master`
2.  `make arm_sdk_install`
3.  `make` <-- Pick out the name of your target device from the supported boards list. For instance, I have a Trampa **VESC 100/250**, so my target is `100_250`
4.   `make 100_250` <-- This will build the **VESC 100/250** firmware and place it into the `bldc/builds/100_250/` directory

## ChibiOS

Firmware builds use upstream ChibiOS `ver21.11.5`, commit
`f4bbadf964fc746aef8bbcf34135c7d8fabb8eae`, in `ChibiOS_21.11.5/`. The source
archive SHA-256 is `CF0B320037EE98DE9DACE8CFA91D5A11E5F2DE32AA28CB923F3EC69AB43A5A0F`.

The STM32 Standard Peripheral Library from the previous ChibiOS 3.0.5 bundle
remains separately in `libstm32f4/` because motor control configures ADC, DMA, and
timers directly through that API. `libstm32f4/assert_compat.h` preserves the
library's disabled `assert_param` behavior, and its legacy flash status name is
renamed to avoid colliding with the ChibiOS flash HAL.

The only ChibiOS source patch preserves the existing baud-dependent USART IRQ
priority in [hal_serial_lld.c](ChibiOS_21.11.5/os/hal/ports/STM32/LLD/USARTv1/hal_serial_lld.c):
priority 4 above 200 kbaud, otherwise 7. The default `-Os` and four-way LTO
settings keep firmware within the bootloader's fixed flash map.

The Flipsky 75/300 target was build-validated with `make fw_fsesc_75_300` using
Arm GCC 14.3.1; its application uses 449,624 of 475,120 bytes. Firmware was not
flashed or run, so hardware behavior remains unverified.

## Building with Nix

Nix is a build tool which manages all dependencies. With [Nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)
enabled, build the general-purpose firmware package from the repository root.

```bash
nix build .#bldc-fw
```

The packaged firmware and `res_fw.qrc` are available under `result/`.
All boards are built by default. `make *_flash` helpers are not supported with nix.

## Other tools

**Linux Optional - Add udev rules to use the stlink v2 programmer without being root**
```bash
wget vedder.se/Temp/49-stlinkv2.rules
sudo mv 49-stlinkv2.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm trigger
```

## IDE
### Prerequisites
#### On macOS/Linux

- `python3`, and `pip`

#### On Windows
- Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Make sure to click the box to add Python3 to your Environment.

### All platforms

1.  `pip install aqtinstall`
2.  `make qt_install`
3.  Open Qt Creator IDE installed in `tools/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/bin/qtcreator`
4.  With Qt Creator, open the vesc firmware Qt Creator project, named vesc.pro. You will find it in `Project/Qt Creator/vesc.pro`
5.  The IDE is configured by default to build 100_250 firmware, this can be changed in the bottom of the left panel, there you will find all hardware variants supported by VESC

## Upload to VESC
### Method 1 - Flash it using an STLink SWD debugger

1.  Build and flash the [bootloader](https://github.com/vedderb/bldc-bootloader) first
2.  Then `_flash` to the target of your choice. So for instance, for the VESC 100/250: 
```bash
make 100_250_flash
```

### Method 2 - Upload Firmware via VESC tool through USB

1.  Clone and build the firmware in **.bin** format as in the above Build instructions

In VESC tool

2.  Connect to the VESC
3.  Navigate to the Firmware tab on the left side menu 
4.  Click on Custom file tab
5.  Click on the folder icon to select the built firmware in .bin format (e.g. `build/100_250/100_250.bin`)

##### [ Reminder : It is normal to see VESC disconnects during the firmware upload process ]  
#####  **[ Warning : DO NOT DISCONNECT POWER/USB to VESC during the upload process, or you will risk bricking your VESC ]**  
#####  **[ Warning : ONLY DISCONNECT your VESC 10s after the upload loading bar completed and "FW Upload DONE" ]**

6.  Press the upload firmware button (downward arrow) on the bottom right to start upload the selected firmware.
7.  Wait for **10s** after the loading bar completed (Warning: unplug sooner will risk bricking your VESC)
8.  The VESC will disconnect itself after new firmware is uploaded.

## In case you bricked your VESC
you will need to upload a new working firmware to the VESC.  
However, to upload a firmware to a bricked VESC, you have to use a SWD Debugger.
